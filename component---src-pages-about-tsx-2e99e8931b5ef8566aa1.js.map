I found my passion for learning computer\n          sciences at the age of 16 and have been programming ever since. I've\n          dedicated countless hours to learning and expanding this passion.\n          Being able to effectively teach myself is something I am most proud of\n          about myself. I have developed an avid work ethic and disciplinary\n          skills along my journey in life. Strong creative and critical thinking\n          skills have helped me to excel in areas like web development as well\n          as functional and object oriented programming. In free my time, I\n          immerse myself in learning new programming technologies and how to\n          better myself as a programmer but also find joy with meditaion, music,\n          hiking, and spending time under the sun.  */}\n          My name is Aditya Samantaray &#128075;. I'm a final year undergraduate\n          student from IIIT Bhubaneswar, India &#127470;&#127475;, currently\n          majoring in Computer Engineering. I've been passionate about computer\n          systems and programming since my high school days and have been coding\n          ever since. I've a knack for learning things fast and have\n          consequently worked hard exploring various fields such as Data\n          Science, Deep Learning, Fullstack Development as well as Site\n          Reliability. I've demonstrated experience in data analytics, full\n          stack development as well as open source projects.

Also, my mentor made me the co-author\n        of Iregnet which provided me with a sense of satisfaction that my hard\n        work bore fruit and now I co-author an R package.\n        <br />\n        My GSOC project had armed me with the knowledge of dealing with\n        production grade code bases. This became evident during my internship\n        with Dell Technologies, wherein to the amazement of my teammates, even\n        with zero prior experience in web development, I was able to get up to\n        speed with our .Net Core project repo and the Gitlab pipelines within a\n        matter of days.\n      </div>\n      <Contact />\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n","/*eslint  jsx-a11y/control-has-associated-label: \"off\"*/\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { HiOutlineMail } from \"react-icons/hi\";\nimport { SiGithub, SiLinkedin } from \"react-icons/si\";\n\nimport \"../../styles/sections/contact.scss\";\n\nconst Contact: React.FC = () => (\n  <div className=\"contact-section\">\n    <div className=\"content-cont\">\n      <h1 className=\"section-title\">Feel free to reach out.</h1>\n      <p>Direct Email</p>\n      <a\n        href=\"mailto:aditya.samantaray1@gmail.com\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      >\n        <button>\n          <HiOutlineMail />\n        </button>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"content-cont\">\n      <p>Other Platforms</p>\n      <div className=\"button-cont\">\n        <a\n          href=\"https://github.com/theadityasam\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noreferrer\"\n        >\n          <button>\n            <SiGithub />\n          </button>\n        </a>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-samantaray\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noreferrer\"\n        >\n          <button>\n            <SiLinkedin />\n          </button>\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Contact;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
