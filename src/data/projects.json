			"process": "A process scheduling simulator that simulates different scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority Pre-emptive(PP) and Priority Non Pre-emptive(PNP).",
			"processSub": "I created a feature rich simulator that was clean, intuitive and supported changing speeds, pause, resume and stop functions. Users can input their own job table as well as generate a random job table. The ready queue as well as Gantt chart is displayed after every second for greater understanding of the working of the algorithms.",

				"Developed applications with Java language",
				"Gained expertise in using GUI builders",
				"Improved skills writing dynamic functions that do more with less code",
				"Improved fundamentals of OOPS and Operating Systems"
